# actual astrolokeys

all love to Cassidoo and sailorhgs' keycaps that got me into mech keyboards in
the first place, but here is a unicode layer for working and student
astrologers pedantically laid out according to Hellenistic essential dignity:

- The home row is the seven classical planets divided by sect.
- The signs all take up the first row above their rulers. You shift to access
    the signs later in the zodiac. Logically, the lunar nodes are right below the
    moon.
- The outer planets are no more than 2 keys from their modern domiciles.
    - Pluto is next to the Aries/Scorpio key, aka QWERTY "P" for unintended
        pneumoic ease;
    - Uranus and Neptune are next to each other under Saturn (Aquarius) and
        Jupiter (Pisces) for my agenda even greater than astrological tradition
        (lesbianism).
- The five major aspects occupy `,./` or `<>?`, which just makes me happy in
    terms of punctuation. Shift to acess the larger angle.
- Bonus for anyone looking at `keymap.c`: the aliases for the seven classical
    planets are their metals in alchemy.
- No pinkies at all other than conjunction!
